# Phisa-Pygame
My first pygame made during Introduction to Software Systems Lab 
## How it works
- It is a two player game
- Phineas collects blue rods
- Isabella collects pink rods
- The one who collects the diamond gets extra points
- At the end, the score and the winner is displayed on the console.
- The players can decide to end the game whenever they want.
## How to run
- Clone the repository/Download the zip file.
- Run the game using the command ``` python game.py ```
